# CompTIA Security+ Study Notes (SY0-701)

Welcome to my personal study repository for the CompTIA Security+ certification exam. These notes are a living document of my journey toward earning the certification, created using a specific, question-focused methodology.

## Source Material ðŸ“š

All notes and question analyses in this repository are based on the following official guide:

> **[CompTIA Security+ Study Guide with over 500 Practice Test Questions: Exam SY0-701, 9th Edition]**(https://dl1.technet24.ir/Downloads/EBooks/Security/CompTIA-Security-Study-Guide-with-over-500-Practice-Test-Questions-Exam-SY0-701-9th-Edition.pdf)

The methodology described below is applied directly to the content and the 500+ practice questions provided in this book.

## A Question-Driven Study Approach

Instead of traditional, passive note-taking, this project follows an active-learning strategy designed for efficiency and retention.

1.  **Analyze the Target:** First, I review and analyze the practice questions (MCQs) associated with a specific chapter in the study guide.
2.  **Identify Core Concepts:** This analysis reveals the key concepts, critical vocabulary, and specific scenarios that are most likely to be tested on the exam.
3.  **Create Targeted Notes:** With a clear understanding of the goal, I then study the chapter's theoretical content and create a concise set of notes. These notes are specifically crafted to provide the core knowledge needed to understand and correctly answer the practice questions from the book.

The goal is to create an efficient and targeted study guide, optimized for practical application and exam success. Good luck with your studies!
